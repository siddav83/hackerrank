The purpose is of this repo is to document my progression in python and java exercises of the next 24 months. 
The aim is to start of with python and aim to complete up to 5 exercises per week starting with the easy, progressing to the much more challenging exercises.
Once I have reach a x level I would like to move on to java. 
My current workplace is mostly working with python and testing frameworks around python. Java will be my pet project I would like to have a better hold on over the next 24 months.
Lets see where this goes 23/03/2023
