The purpose is of this repo is to document my progression in python and java exercises over the next 24 months. 
The aim is to start of with python and aim to complete up to 5 exercises per week. Starting with the easy, progressing to the more challenging exercises.
Once I have reach a (x) level I would like to move on to java. 
My work's tech stack and testing frameworks are mostly around python. Java will be my pet project I would like to have a better hold over it within the next 24 months.
Lets see where this goes - dated 23/03/2023
